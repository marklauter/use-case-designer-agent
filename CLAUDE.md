# CLAUDE.md

Use case modeling agent. Designs use case models through goal-directed Socratic interviews grounded in Alan Cooper's goal-oriented design and Eric Evans' domain-driven design.

## Output

All durable output requested by the user is written as markdown files unless otherwise specified. Prefer prose, bulleted and numbered lists over tables.

## Modeling

`.claude/modeling/` contains the instruction set for domain modeling.

- **`principles/`** — core beliefs and philosophical prose that creators follow when producing content
- **`governance/`** — verification rules that reviewers follow when checking content
- **`forms/`** — structural contracts for artifacts. Each form defines the sections, ordering, and placeholder guidance for one artifact type. Forms are named after their matching structuring skill (e.g., `structuring-usecases` skill → `structuring-usecases.md` form).
- Process documents at the root describe the design workflow.

Read the matching form before writing any artifact. The form is the structural authority — same sections, same ordering. When a new artifact type is introduced, create a form in `.claude/modeling/forms/` and a corresponding structuring skill in `.claude/skills/`.

Read before writing reference documentation: `.claude/modeling/principles/writing-documentation.md`

## Agents

- **`designing-usecases`** at `.claude/agents/designing-usecases.md` — use case lens specialist. Formalizes domain structure into use case artifacts through Socratic interview. Takes a primary actor and conditional goal as input. Preloads philosophy, forms, and editorial skills.

## Sample model

`models/marklauter/github-wiki-agent/` contains a complete reference model (GitHub wiki management system) demonstrating all artifact types. Use it as a guide for structure, voice, and level of detail.

## Conventions

- Model output directory: `models/{owner}/{repo}/` (mirrors GitHub URL structure)
- Actor files: `actors/{nn}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `actors/01-user.md`)
- Use case files: `use-cases/{nn}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `use-cases/01-populate-new-wiki.md`)
- Context files: `contexts/{nn}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `contexts/01-wiki-creation.md`)
- Event files: `events/{nn}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `events/01-wiki-populated.md`)
- Invariant files: `invariants/{nn}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `invariants/01-source-repo-readonly.md`)
- Index files: `{topic}/index.md` in each artifact folder (e.g., `actors/index.md`)
- Note files: `notes/{ISO-datetime}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `notes/2026-02-21T1430-historian-as-skill.md`)
- Glossary: `GLOSSARY.md` at model root
- Domain events: PastTense names (e.g., `WikiPopulated`, `FindingFiled`)
- Actors: capitalize role names (User, Orchestrator)
- Every artifact follows its matching form exactly — same sections, same ordering
- Prefer sections, bullets, numbered lists, or prose over tables.

## Contracts

A **contract** is the atomic unit of modeling knowledge. Each contract has two expressions that share the same name:

- The **modeling file** in `.claude/modeling/` (a principle, a form, or a governance rule) is the structural contract — it defines what to produce or what to verify, and carries the authoritative prose.
- The **skill file** in `.claude/skills/` is the behavioral contract — it defines who the agent becomes when it loads the skill. The skill's YAML `description` is optimized for skill triggering and is the source of truth for the opening paragraph.

Both files carry the same body. The modeling file has an H1 title and an opening description paragraph that matches the skill's YAML `description` exactly.

When the skill description and the modeling description diverge, the skill description wins — but meaningful content in the modeling description that would be lost must be preserved by inserting it into the body as a new section.

When editing a contract, update both files and verify both before reporting complete.

## Renaming and refactoring

When renaming or moving files, always search the entire project for references to the old name/path and update them. Verify with a final grep that zero stale references remain before reporting the task complete.

## Multi-agent orchestration

When spawning sub-agents via the Task tool, keep role boundaries clear:
- The orchestrator dispatches work and merges results. It does not apply editorial judgment.
- Editorial personas, judgment rules, and review standards belong in the sub-agent prompts, not the orchestrator.
- Verify sub-agents have the tool permissions they need (especially Write and Edit) before delegating file-writing tasks.
