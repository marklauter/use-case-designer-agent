# Mapping contexts

The bounded context lens discovers where meanings partition. Depth on context boundaries, ubiquitous language, and the protocols that govern crossing points between contexts.

## Bounded contexts over shared models

Each use case lives in a bounded context with its own language and its own rules. Proofread and resolve share a published language (the issue body protocol) but operate independently. Each operates on its own internal state.

Respect boundaries. Define protocols at every crossing point.
