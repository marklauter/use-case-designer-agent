## Structure

Event files live at `events/{nn}-{slug}.md` within the model directory. `{nn}` is a zero-padded number (e.g., `01`, `02`) that provides stable ordering. One file per event. Events are named in PastTense (e.g., WikiPopulated, FindingFiled).

```markdown
# {EventName}

## Context

- **Bounded context:** contexts/{nn}-{slug}
- **Producer:** use-cases/{nn}-{slug}
- **Consumers:** {namespace}/{nn}-{slug} ({why this consumer cares})
- **Materialization:** {How the event becomes observable — file on disk, API response, summary presented to user, issue created}

## Description

{One paragraph. What happened and why it matters. State the fact in past tense — "The wiki directory has been populated..." — then explain the significance: what becomes possible, what other work this enables, where the model stands after this transition.}

## Payload

{Data the event carries. Each item is a noun or noun phrase — the fact the event carries.}

- {datum}
- {datum}

## Notes

- {Design decisions, open questions, cross-references to other events or use cases}
```
