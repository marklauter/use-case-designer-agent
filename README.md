# use-case-designer-agent

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agent that designs use case models through goal-directed Socratic interviews. Grounded in Alan Cooper's goal-oriented design and Eric Evans' domain-driven design.

You describe your system. The agent asks questions, structures your answers, and produces a complete use case model — actors with drives, invariants, domain events, bounded contexts, and scenarios that express intent rather than mechanics.

## How it works

The agent conducts a phased interview for each use case:

1. **Goal discovery** — What is the actor trying to achieve? Why does it matter? How would they know it succeeded?
2. **Invariants and constraints** — What rules must never be violated? What is readonly? What external dependencies exist?
3. **Domain events** — What meaningful state transitions occur? What facts does this use case publish?
4. **Scenario and obstacles** — Walk through the success path in terms of intent. What could prevent the goal?
5. **Grounding** — Read source files to verify the scenario matches reality. Flag gaps.

The agent asks one phase at a time, summarizes what it heard, and moves on. It extracts structure from your domain knowledge — it does not invent requirements.

## What it produces

A use case model is a set of interconnected artifacts:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PHILOSOPHY.md` | Guiding principles — the constitution of the model |
| `TEMPLATE.md` | Structural contract for individual use cases |
| `UC-{id}-{slug}.md` | Individual use cases — one goal, one primary actor |
| `ACTOR-CATALOG.md` | Every actor, their drives, and where they appear |
| `SHARED-INVARIANTS.md` | Cross-cutting rules that apply system-wide |
| `USE-CASE-CATALOG.md` | Index of all use cases and bounded contexts |
| `domains/DC-{id}-{slug}.md` | Bounded context definitions |
| `domains/DOMAIN-EVENTS.md` | Published events that cross context boundaries |
| `GLOSSARY.md` | Canonical vocabulary for the model |

See [UC-MODEL-ARTIFACTS.md](.claude/guidance/UC-MODEL-ARTIFACTS.md) for full descriptions of each artifact and their relationships.

## Key ideas

- **Actors have drives.** An actor is not a tool. A tool does exactly what you tell it. An actor makes decisions shaped by what it cares about. Drives make actors predictable in a modeling sense.
- **Goals over tasks.** Use cases describe desired end states, not step sequences. Goals survive implementation changes.
- **Invariants over preconditions.** Domain rules hold continuously — not just at entry.
- **Intent over mechanics.** Scenario steps say what is accomplished, not how.
- **Extract, don't invent.** The user knows the domain. The agent knows how to structure it.

See [UC-PHILOSOPHY.md](.claude/guidance/UC-PHILOSOPHY.md) for all 12 principles.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed

## Getting started

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marklauter/use-case-designer-agent.git
   cd use-case-designer-agent
   ```

2. **Open in Claude Code:**

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Start designing.** Tell the agent about a system you want to model. It will begin the interview process and guide you through each phase.

The agent reads [UC-PHILOSOPHY.md](.claude/guidance/UC-PHILOSOPHY.md) and [UC-TEMPLATE.md](.claude/guidance/UC-TEMPLATE.md) before every session to maintain consistency across use cases.

## Sample model

A complete reference model is included at [samples/wiki-agent/](samples/wiki-agent/). It models a GitHub wiki management system across 6 designed use cases, 6 bounded contexts, and 7 domain events. Start with [USE-CASE-CATALOG.md](samples/wiki-agent/USE-CASE-CATALOG.md) for an overview.

## Design process

The model is built in phases — sequential in tendency, not in practice. Discovery at any phase can revise earlier work.

1. **Establish principles** — Write PHILOSOPHY.md and TEMPLATE.md
2. **Design individual use cases** — Socratic interviews, one at a time
3. **Consolidate** — Extract shared actors, invariants, and protocols
4. **Model the domain** — Formalize bounded contexts and domain events
5. **Refine** — Remove implementation leaks, verify cross-references, reconcile with reality

See [UC-MODEL-DESIGN-PHASES.md](.claude/guidance/UC-MODEL-DESIGN-PHASES.md) for the full process guide.
