# Phase0

Phase0 is a domain discovery tool. Through Socratic questioning, a facilitator agent extracts domain knowledge from a human expert and formalizes it into a vision statement — the foundation from which use case models, bounded contexts, and agentic systems are built.

## The vision

The `vision/` folder contains the Phase0 vision as a set of standalone articles. Each can be read independently; together they describe the full system.

**Start here:**

- [Manifesto](vision/manifesto.md) — what Phase0 is, what it produces, and why it exists

**Core concepts:**

- [Conditional goals](vision/conditional-goals.md) — the foundational modeling concept: desired end states plus value conditions, and the derivation chain that produces the entire system design
- [The Socratic method](vision/socratic-method.md) — why Socratic extraction works, and the techniques it employs: the why-chain, noun refinement, and contradictions as gold

**The process:**

- [The discovery process](vision/discovery-process.md) — how a facilitated session unfolds, in four natural rounds

**The architecture:**

- [The agentic architecture](vision/agentic-architecture.md) — how Phase0 is built: the facilitator, the lenses, and the specialist agents
- [The historian](vision/historian.md) — who holds the threads when the conversation runs long

**The product:**

- [The vision statement artifact](vision/vision-statement-artifact.md) — what Phase0 actually produces, its structure, and how you know when it is done

## Source document

[VISION.md](VISION.md) is the original discussion notes from which these articles were refined. It remains as the source of truth for verification.
