# Phase0 — design notes

Eating our own dogfood. Using Phase0 to discover Phase0's own actors, goals, and design.

## Primary actor

**Builder** — someone who wants to build a repeatable agentic workflow automation. May also be the domain expert, but the role that makes them the primary actor is that they want something built.

## Conditional goal

Desired end state: *a repeatable agentic workflow automation operates in my domain.*

### Value conditions (in progress)

- **Repeatable** — a process that a cognitive being, human or synthetic agent, can follow. Repeatable does not mean deterministic. Think coder and reviewer — mistakes happen and get caught and remediated.
- **Autonomous** — cognitive workflow that does not require constant human intervention.
- **Reliable** — works consistently.

### Value condition candidates (not yet confirmed)

- **Traceable** — when the workflow makes a mistake, you can follow the chain back to where it went wrong. Agents make decisions; those decisions need to be auditable.
- **Evolvable** — the domain changes, the workflow adapts without a full redesign.
- **Grounded** — the workflow is rooted in actual domain knowledge, not assumptions. May be Phase0's specific contribution rather than a general value condition.

## Supporting actors

Not yet identified. Domain expert is a supporting actor — has the knowledge but Phase0 does not exist to serve them.

## Open questions

- Are the three value condition candidates confirmed, rejected, or refined?
- What tensions do these value conditions expose?
- What supporting actors do those tensions spawn?
