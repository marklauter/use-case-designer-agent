# Post-write validation is proto-governance

## Context

Discovered while reviewing the designing-usecases agent after adding preserving-discoveries and writing-notes skills. Asked whether the agent had reached its final form.

## Body

The post-write validation section in designing-usecases is verification logic baked into the agent — re-read indexes, check consistency, flag mismatches. This is proto-governance: the agent acting as its own proofreader. When the governance layer matures, this section may migrate out of the agent definition and into a verification contract that a dedicated proofreader applies. For now, self-checking is the right call because no proofreader agent exists yet.
