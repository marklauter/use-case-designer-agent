# Actors map to skills

## Context

Discovered while discussing how the designing-usecases agent embodies multiple roles without separate agents.

## Body

An actor is a role with goals and responsibilities. A skill is a behavioral contract an agent loads. Loading a skill is putting on a hat — the agent adopts the actor's goals and judgment. This means a single agent can embody multiple actors by loading multiple skills, avoiding context-burning coordination overhead. The boundary is drive compatibility: complementary drives combine, opposing drives stay separate.
