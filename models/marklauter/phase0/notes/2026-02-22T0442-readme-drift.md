# README.md has accumulated drift

## Context

Discovered while scanning CLAUDE.md and README.md for drift after adding preserving-discoveries, writing-notes, and write-as-you-go behavior.

## Body

The README needs updates in several areas:
- Skills list (line 82) is stale — missing preserving-discoveries and writing-notes.
- 'How it works' section describes a 5-phase interview including 'Grounding — Read source files' which is not part of the current agent process.
- 'What it produces' section is missing the notes/ folder.
- 'Design process' section references retired artifacts (PHILOSOPHY.md, TEMPLATE.md).
- Principles list is missing preserving-discoveries.md.
- Forms list is missing note.md.
- No mention of write-as-you-go behavior — the headline durability change that ensures discoveries survive session boundaries. This should be prominent.

## References
